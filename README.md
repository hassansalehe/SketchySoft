Programming Through Sketchy Flow Charts.

I propose an intelligent user interface application for writing computer programs using sketch
recognition and software engineering flow charts. Basically, the application should be able to
recognize flow charts sketched on a surface of a smart or touch screen and transform them into a
program source code in programming languages like C and Python. Then, it should be able to present
error-free source code to the user. In case the flow charts results in erroneous code it should inform the
sketcher interactively of the part which causes error(s) .To use the application it suffices for a
programmer to know the flow chart constructs to write a, say, C program.
